As a software developer who’s transitioned to many roles as a
self-employed freelancer, it’s important to keep a set of great software
tools. Most importantly tools which help me optimize rather than
distract me. Therefore, here’s a list of productivity apps and services
I use to keep my workflow going. In contrast, these are not development
tools necessarily but rather software which helps with other *office*
work which I do. To begin with, you’ll need an easy way to install, run,
and track your application as well as your computer’s disk space.

## Managing Productivity Apps and Disk

For many developers, we live in the command line. Therefore, using a
package manager is a great way to install apps without the need to load
a distracting web page. For instance, on Linux there’s
[apt](https://wiki.debian.org/Apt#How%5C_to%5C_use.3F) or
[yum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yum%5C_(software)); Windows has
[Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org) and on the Mac is
[Homebrew](https://brew.sh "Homebrew") which is what I use. Altogether,
this allows you also to track what you have installed especially using
[Homebrew Bundle](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-bundle). Outside
of the Mac App Store, Homebrew is a great way to install and manage your
productivity apps.

Secondly, one of the first apps I install on my Mac is
[Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/?ref=okproductive). In essence,
Alfred not only is superior to the Spotlight search but also offers a
plethoria of different services you can integrate with. Thereupon, you
can simply map a hot key to that service and it’ll allow you to search
for apps, contacts, do math problems, or give you directions.

While installing all of your productivity apps, you may need to watch
your disk space. That’s where
[Daisydisk](http://cl.ly/ehYa?ref=empowerapps) comes in. In short,
DaisyDisk gives you great visualization of how your disk space is used
as well as how to cleanup your disk. In contrast to tracking your disk
space, let’s talk about a real productivity challenge - tracking your
time.

## Time Tracking and Scheduling Apps

With many of my clients and partners, I need to schedule meetings and
track my time. Specifically, there’s one app I use for arranging
meetings - that is [Doodle](https://doodle.com/). That is to say, Doodle
is a platform which allows for easy polling and basic surveys including
scheduling. For instance, I can easily share a poll which asks
participants the best time to meet from a set of times available. Once
votes are placed, I can send them an invite easily.

As far as tracking my time, I currently use [Toggl](https://toggl.com/).
Generally speaking, Toggl doesn’t come with a lot of bells and whistles,
however its open API and simplicity make it ideal for reporting and
tracking.

## Reminders and Todo List Productivity Apps

For tracking my tasks, currently I use a combination of weekly
Spreadsheets and [Todoist.](https://todoist.com/) In particular, Todoist
offers the ability to share tasks easily with others whether it’s a
podcast episode I am working on or a shopping list with my wife.
Additionally, I can easily group tasks as well set priorities and due
dates.


Conversely I also use spreadsheets to track my weekly items. (I use
Numbers - of course you can use Excel or Google Sheets) As an example I
simply add the name of the task (*Write a Development Tools*) and assign
a priority and desire between 0-100 (99) as well as approximate minutes
(3 hours?). Lastly, I sort by priority and desire and then based on my
availability, work on the top items for that week. Then, each week I
copy the sheet into a new one, delete the completed items, copy the old
priorities over, set new priorities for the week, and repeat.

## Notes and Writing Productivity Apps

For developers, MarkDown has become the most convenient way to organize
as well as create documents. If you are not familiar with Markdown, I
highly recommend taking 30 minutes and becoming familiar with it:

-   [Adam Pritchard’s Quick
    Reference](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)
-   [Github’s Mastering
    Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
-   [John Gruber’s Markdown
    Guide](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)

Whether it’s communications, documentation, blogging, or note taking,
Markdown is a great way to keep your text organized and formatted.
Therefore many note taking apps use Markdown, including the one I use -
[Bear](https://bear.app/?ref=okproductive). To point out, Bear works
only on iOS and Mac and a web front-end is in the works. However, Bear’s
strong point is its simplicity, versatility as well as UI.

Conversely, if you prefer to use something besides Bear or any Markdown
specific app, there’s always Google Docs. Most importantly, since Google
Docs is so widely accepted, sharing documents has become easy and
painless. For instance, I’ll explicitly use Google Docs for show notes
and any long form writing which needs to be shared.

For other long-form writing, I am a big fan of
[Ulysses](https://ulysses.app/?ref=empowerapps). Just as with Bear,
[Ulysses](https://ulysses.app/?ref=empowerapps) is specifically for
macOS and iOS, however its purpose is explicitly long-form
distraction-free writing. Most importantly, it has a great UI and has
helped keep my writing organized and flow easily. Additionally, it can
export to several formats such as Word Doc, HTML, PDF, Wordpress,
Medium, and more. Besides my writing, I also record podcasts and do
video as well.

## Creative Apps

For doing any multimedia, <a
href="https://leogdion.name/2019/06/13/podcasting-getting-started-content-recording-audience/"
rel="noreferrer noopener"
aria-label="including podcasting (opens in a new tab)"
target="_blank">including podcasting</a>, I recommend two suites: Adobe
or Apple. First, [Adobe’s Creative
Cloud](https://www.adobe.com/?ref=empowerapps) is great if that is a
focus of what you do. For instance, I’ve used Photoshop, Illustrator,
Premier, and Audition and each have helped with artwork, video
production, and podcast production. However if its steep price is too
much for you, I’d recommend looking at what Apple provides for free with
iMovie and GarageBand. Most importantly, both offer plenty for beginners
as well as intermediates before you move to Apple’s Logic or Final Cut
Pro.

Similarly, for recording video I use [OBS](https://obsproject.com) as
well as [FiLMiC Pro](https://www.filmicpro.com/?ref=empowerapps). OBS is
great for live streaming demos or tutorials as well as on-screen
recording. Conversely, OBS has a learning curve but there’s a lot you
can do as a beginner. On the other hand for recording my presentations
or video of myself, I use FiLMiC Pro on my iPhone. For one thing as
advanced as iPhones are, you can do videos at 4K resolution and 60
Frames Per Second. In addition, I also use [FiLMiC
Remote](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/filmic-remote/id661488661?ref=empowerapps)
on a second iPhone to preview and control the recording as it is being
done.

Afterwards once I’ve edited the video or audio recording, I’ll need to
share it with my audience.

## Marketing Apps

Social media can be quite overwhelming, which is why I have a set of
productivity apps to keep me active as opposed to distracted. For
instance, [Buffer](https://buffer.com/?ref=empowerapps) is a great way
to make sure your social media queue is active without constantly being
reminded by what’s out there. Furthermore, Buffer can connect with
several social media accounts as well as allow you to schedule posts
with existing media. Besides social media, email is still actively used
by many folks. Therefore, [Mailchimp](https://mailchimp.com) is a great
service for starting your own email list. For instance, whenever I need
to update folks on products, services, content; Mailchimp allows for me
to automate and schedule email out to my various audiences.

Along with email, there are other ways to contact my business partners
and clients.

## Communication Apps

Besides email I use [Slack](https://slack.com/?ref=empowerapps) pretty
frequently. Slack is a great way to communicate with a team, find a
community, or share documents. Notably, there is practically a Slack
community for all sorts of developer languages, frameworks, and tools.
In addition, Slack also uses Markdown for text formatting, has great
shortcuts to channels and folks, and a decent bot and developer
ecosystem for customization.

When a Slack message or email won’t do, I typically setup video meetings
with [Zoom](https://zoom.us/). Most importantly, what Zoom brings to
video conferencing is simplicity and the ability to just work. Besides
its app (which is offered on multiple platforms), Zoom requires nothing
else. After finding the right time for the meeting, I’ll schedule a time
and send a link to the meeting using Zoom. Zoom also allows for
recording of video calls for later reference.

## Avoid Over Optimizing Productivity Apps

Finding the best productivity apps can be great but avoid being sucked
in by it’s endless list of features. Have it do the job you want and be
done with it. One of the biggest time sucks is over optimization of apps
as well. Don’t spend too much time finding the right app or learning
every shortcut and feature it offers.

I hope this list of productivity apps is helpful to you or wherever you
work. If you are interested in learning more check out my podcast with
