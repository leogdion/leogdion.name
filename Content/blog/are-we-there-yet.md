Storytellers,</a> a bi-monthly event where professionally coached, local
storytellers of all ages share their best stories. The theme for
September was "Are We There Yet?". In this story, I spoke about my wife
and our challenges having children, dealing infertility, and working
with foster children and adoption as well as dealing with unexpected
challenges.
