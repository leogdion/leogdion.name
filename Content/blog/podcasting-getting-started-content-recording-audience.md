It has been at least 15 years but I remember as soon as iTunes came to
Windows, I downloaded podcasts. For example, it could have been the
software development podcast,
<a href="https://dotnetrocks.com" rel="noreferrer noopener"
aria-label="dotNet Rocks (opens in a new tab)" target="_blank">dotNet
Rocks</a>, or the financial podcast,
<a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/money/" target="_blank"
rel="noreferrer noopener"
aria-label="Planet Money (opens in a new tab)">Planet Money</a>, giving
a narration and analysis of the 2008 Financial Crash as it happened.
**Generally speaking, podcasting as these podcasts do, gives specific
audiences an in-depth specialized analysis without the need to appeal to
the general audience.**

Therefore in 2017, I decided to jump into podcasting and start two
podcasts: [one on personal productivity](https://okproductive.com) and
[another for my business on software development for Apple
hardware](https://www.empowerapps.show). Important to realize, both
podcasts are some sort of combination of passion, business, and
expertise. And so, I want to talk about the ins and outs of podcasting.
That means:

-   [Why should you start a podcast](#why-should-you-start-a-podcast)
-   [How to build content](#building-content)
-   [How to stay organized](#staying-organized)
-   [Recording and editing audio](#recording-and-editing-your-audio)
-   [Hosting and Publishing](#podcasting-hosts-and-publishing)
-   [Reaching Your Audience](http://reaching-your-podcast-audience)

First of all, the \#1 question you should ask is **why you should start
a podcast**.

## Why Should You Start a Podcast?

Podcasting may sound simple at first but to really be successful at it
you need perseverance. Therefore, you need to really have a good reason
and passion to do for a while. For this reason, rather than discussing
**how to start podcast** let’s discuss the why.

### Promote Yourself and Your Skills

Most importantly, sharing your expertise on the web provides a great
example to others. However, more so than a written format, talking about
a topic is a more natural means for people. Uniquely, rather than giving
a talk to 40 people, podcasting allows you to present on topic many
times over. In addition, not only can you sell yourself but a product as
well.

### Sell A Product

Podcasting can be a great way to sell your products. By starting a
podcast, you can give your products a narrative and showcase as to how
they are helpful. However, **the most important part of selling anything
on the web is to provide actual informative valuable content.** Don’t
just sell but provide advice - You build trust as well as true expertise
on the product’s subject matter.

### Enjoy a Topic or Hobby through Podcasting

While selling yourself or your products are good reasons, you need to
have some sense of enjoyment or passion to really carry out the momentum
of producing a podcast show. Recently on Pat Flynn’s Smart Passive
Income podcast, <a
href="https://www.smartpassiveincome.com/podcasts/how-powerhouse-youtuber-marques-brownlee-mkbhd-grew-his-massive-brand/"
target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"
aria-label=" he interviewed MKBHD (opens in a new tab)">he interviewed
MKBHD</a>, a YouTube tech reviewer with over 8 million subscribers.
**MKBHD revealed on the show he produced 100 videos before he even had
100 subscribers.** Building an audience with your show is going to be a
long and slow process. For this reason, having enjoyment and passion in
podcasting will give you the momentum to carry it through that long
process. As a result, if you do decide to start a show though, it’s
important to know where to start.

## How To Get Started Podcasting?

Podcasting involves five components: **content, organization, audio,
hosting, and reaching your audience**. With this in mind, having
engaging content is perhaps the most important.

<figure class="wp-block-image is-resized">
<img
src="https://leogdion.name/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/patrick-tomasso-71909-unsplash-690-e1560427978579.jpeg"
class="wp-image-196" width="1024" height="576" alt="Content" />
</figure>

### Building Content

Based on why you starting your podcast and the type of show you are
doing, you need to build a list of topics for your show. With this
intention, you need build on your existing expertise and passion while
also finding your audience and seeking their pain points.

#### Build On Your Existing Expertise and Passion

As a result, by building on your passion and expertise, you sound
natural and engaging. Nevertheless, if you get stuck compiling a list of
topics based on your expertise alone, you can look to your potential
audience online. Additionally your audience online will give you insight
into their questions or challenges.

#### Find Your Audience and Their Challenges

The web is a great way to reach your audience but it’s also a great way
for you to find your audience and the challenges they face. For example,
Reddit, Quora, Stackoverflow, Slack Workspace, Youtube Comments,
Twitter, Facebook Groups, and any website forum - as long as there is
engagement there - is a great opportunity to see what your audience is
facing as far as difficulties and where their pain is. They don’t need
to be listeners of your podcast already - they just need to be the
people you are targeting. Along with your knowledge, you should have
enough content to get started. The important thing is to keep that
content organized.

class="wp-image-194" width="1024" height="514"
alt="Organizing Your Production" />
</figure>

### Staying Organized

There are two key components to staying organized with your podcast:
having prepared notes before you record and having a consistent
recording and publishing schedule.

#### Have Prepared Notes Before You Record

Behind the scenes of every great show are some sort of notes when it
comes to the topic of each episode. Moreover, even when talking
off-the-cuff, it’s important to have anchor points for your discussion.
Furthermore, some shows even go so far so to have a complete script. In
the end, it really depends on you and the type of show you are
producing. Most importantly, the worst flaw is losing your train of
thought and having **not enough to talk about.** Therefore, the most
natural way of doing this is by talking about what you are an expert at
and passionate about. As a result, there are several methods of breaking
down any topic into prepared notes:

-   5 W’s - Who, What, Where, Why, HoW
-   Chronological Narrative
-   Essay Format - Thesis Statement with Three Points

With this in mind, whatever format you choose make sure you have a
structure and stick with it. If your content has structure, it will give
your audience an easier way to organize the content and make it
memorable. In addition, building these pre-show notes are a great way to
indicate to yourself that you have enough content. Afterwards, these
pre-show notes give you an skeleton you will fill in later for the show
notes which will be posted publicly with your episode’s metadata. For
example, check out <a
href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vQlL4J06mtBQDlc5JJuWxd1k7gLshk4wsyy-CPqFypSJ_I29UUZnqwmTADXh448_YsfcqYgGYLDsWOy/pub"

aria-label="this sample from the episodes Erik and I did for OK Productive on the book Atomic Habits by James Clear (opens in a new tab)">this
sample from the episodes Erik and I did for OK Productive on the book
Atomic Habits by James Clear</a>. In the same way pre-show notes give
you a skeleton to work with, consistency in your schedule can help
continue your show’s momentum.

#### Have A Consistent Schedule

Having a consistent schedule, both in recording and publishing, sets
your audience expectations and makes sure you build a habit and flow
with recording. For example, what I do set aside every Thursday morning
to record an episode of each of my podcasts and publish every other week
each podcast. By doing this, I have built a habit and expectation on my
part that I’ll record every week. Additionally, with the recording to
publishing ratio being 2:1, I have now a buffer of episodes, in case
something happens: sickness, vacation, etc…. As far as publishing, I
have a pretty consistent schedule, publishing every Saturday night or
early Sunday morning. Based on playing around with different days, it
seems most folks download episodes at the beginning of the work week.
This could differ with your audience but clearly setting those
expectations are helpful to your audience. Now that we have pre-episode
notes and a regular recording schedule, let’s talk about recording.

class="wp-image-211" width="1024" height="512"
alt="Recording Equipement" />
</figure>

### Working with Audio

The most technical aspect of podcasting is recording and editing your
episode. However before we began, I want to reiterate one point: **don’t
sink money in the best equipment until you are sure that you’ll stick
with podcasting**. Surprisingly, you may already have much of the
equipment and there is plenty of free software to do this. As a result,
I’d recommend spending some money on better equipment and software
perhaps around the 6 month - 9 month time range or once you’ve recorded
approximately 10 - 12 episodes and have a rhythm in your schedule.
Firstly, the equipment which takes in your voice before anything else is
going to be your microphone.

#### Your Podcasting Microphone

Your microphone is going to be your first connection to your audience.
When first starting off, I’d recommend using a microphone - any
microphone. Most importantly, don’t rely on your laptop microphone and
webcam microphone for your audio. In addition, test your audio recording
before moving to an editing phase. As far as microphone upgrades, the
next step is spending money ($50 - $99) on something like what I use:
[Audio-Technica
ATR2100-USB](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004QJOZS4/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_U_mPKRCbM5KJ91F)
In addition, they also sell a [combo which include a pop filter and
studio](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01MSQFIRE/ref=ppx_od_dt_b_asin_title_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1),
that I use and highly recommend.

Once you’ve reached a point where you wish to go even more professional,
you’ll want to look a more expensive microphones and a mixer/pre-amp.
These will give an even better sound, more control, and better realtime
feedback of your audio. Here are some links which you might find
helpful:

-   [Transistor.FM - How to start a
    podcast](https://transistor.fm/how-to-start-a-podcast/)
-   [The Best Podcast Microphones on the
    Market](https://www.thepodcasthost.com/equipment/the-best-podcasting-microphones-on-the-market/)
-   [25 of the Best Podcast Microphones For Any
    Budget](https://discoverpods.com/best-podcast-mic-podcasting-microphone/)

Therefore, once you have a good microphone for recording, you’ll need
software to record your audio.

#### Recording and Editing Your Audio

Recording software can be fairly simple and inexpensive. For example,
there’s free software such as
<a href="https://www.apple.com/mac/garageband/" target="_blank"
rel="noreferrer noopener"
aria-label="Garageband (opens in a new tab)">Garageband</a> and
<a href="https://www.audacityteam.org" rel="noreferrer noopener"
aria-label="Audacity (opens in a new tab)" target="_blank">Audacity</a>
for macOS and Windows/Linux respectively. However, if you are planning
to edit your podcast then it maybe worth your money to purchase
something like:
<a href="https://www.apple.com/logic-pro/" rel="noreferrer noopener"
aria-label="Apple’s Logic Pro (opens in a new tab)"
target="_blank">Apple’s Logic Pro</a> or
<a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/audition.html"
rel="noreferrer noopener"
aria-label="Adobe Audition (opens in a new tab)" target="_blank">Adobe
Audition</a> which give you more granular control over editing
functionality.

##### Remote Interviews

Specifically, remote interviews can present its fair share of
challenges. For example there are recording apps such as
<a href="https://zencastr.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"
aria-label="Zencaster (opens in a new tab)">Zencaster</a> which
specialize in this. Additionally, you could also record your interview
over a conferencing service like
<a href="https://zoom.us" rel="noreferrer noopener"
aria-label="Zoom (opens in a new tab)" target="_blank">Zoom</a> or
<a href="https://hangouts.google.com" rel="noreferrer noopener"
aria-label="Google Hangouts (opens in a new tab)" target="_blank">Google
Hangouts</a> strip the audio portion and turn that into an episode.
Surprisingly though, the conferencing choice of most podcasters is
<a href="https://www.skype.com/" rel="noreferrer noopener"
aria-label="Skype (opens in a new tab)" target="_blank">Skype</a>.
However you’ll want to record you and your interviewee on separate
tracks. For instance as a macOS user, I use Soundflower to map my audio
channels properly (i.e. my microphone and Skype audio to separate
tracks). Furthermore, I also encourage my guest to record there own
audio since sound quality via Skype isn’t the best.

##### Editing Audio

Therefore, once you’ve recorded your audio, the next step is editing.
Most importantly, having a great recording helps increase the quality of
the recording overall. That is to say avoiding filler words, dead air,
and meandering rants will improve the quality over any recording.
However, in the end, editing will typically be needed. With editing, you
want to make sure your sound is clear (and there are a variety of
filters to do this).

Editing can also be the most time consuming. For this reason, I’ve
started [outsourcing my editing](https://www.podcastedition.com).
Another alternative is using something like
<a href="http://descript.com/" rel="noreferrer noopener"
target="_blank">Descript</a>, a next-generation audio/video editing
platform. I primarily use it for transcribing episodes but it’s actually
capable of doing full audio and video editing. Lastly, we’ll need to
export the file.

#### Exporting and Tagging Your Files

An often forgotten step is including helpful metadata and proper
formatting of the resulting mp3 file. Therefore, include the correct
podcasting metadata and be sure to export as a mono 64kpbs mp3 file.
Luckily, most editing tools provide a means to attach metadata such as
podcast title, episode title, summary, and chapters with your episode.
In the end, you’ll have your brand new episode as an mp3 file. The
question then becomes where to upload your file.

<figure class="wp-block-image">

class="wp-image-198" alt="Hosting Your Audio" />
</figure>

### Podcasting Hosts and Publishing

Hosting your show can tend to be a bit of a maze:

-   a place to put your mp3 file
-   a place to host your show’s website
-   a way to broadcast to various MP3 players

#### Hosting Your Mp3 Files

First thing first, do not try to host your own mp3 files. In contract to
simple web pages, these can take several MBs of data and when as many as
a hundred people are downloading your episodes you can be bitten by
download limits, speed issues, and various other issues. For example,
when I first started out, I hosted the website on Wordpress and the mp3
files on Amazon S3. In reality, this involved a lot of manual processes
with each episode. Therefore, once my Wordpress sites were hacked, I
knew I had transition to a dedicated podcast hosting provider. As a
result, I moved to [Transistor](https://transistor.fm/?via=leo), which
has worked out fantastically. Other services which do this are:

-   <a href="https://soundcloud.com/" target="_blank"
    rel="noreferrer noopener"
    aria-label="Soundcloud (opens in a new tab)">Soundcloud</a>
-   <a href="https://www.blubrry.com" rel="noreferrer noopener"
    aria-label="Blubrry (opens in a new tab)" target="_blank">Blubrry</a>
-   [Podbean](https://www.podbean.com)
-   <a href="https://libsyn.com" rel="noreferrer noopener"
    aria-label="Libsyn (opens in a new tab)" target="_blank">Libsyn</a>
-   <a href="https://anchor.fm" rel="noreferrer noopener"
    aria-label="Anchor (opens in a new tab)" target="_blank">Anchor</a>

Significantly, remember with all these hosts, there could be download
caps, ad insertion, speed throttling and more which could hinderacne
your experience. In the end you’ll get what you pay for.

Be that as it may, each host will provide a place to upload your mp3
files, provide additional metadata, as well as more elaborate public
show notes (as opposed to the pre-show notes you use for talking
points). In the end you should have a publicly available RSS feed for
your show.

#### Publishing to the Web

As far a website, services like
[Transistor](https://transistor.fm/?via=leo), come with a website of
some sort and other services like Blubrry integrate with Wordpress.
However what’s even more important than a website is making sure your
audio is delivered to the numerous podcast clients. Therefore, each
podcasting host will deliver an RSS feed which contains metadata about
the show as well as continually updated list of episodes. As as result,
you’ll use this to *claim ownership of your podcast*. Consequently,
before submitting, make sure you have **at the very least 3 episodes
uploaded as well as a correct author email address setup with your
podcast host**. With this in mind, while most clients let you manually
add RSS feeds, most users will expect to find your show by searching.
Therefore, here is a brief list of clients and how to get your show
posted there:

##### iTunes

Sign up through [podcast
connect](https://itunesconnect.apple.com/login?module=PodcastsConnect)
with your show’s RSS feed. This is also used by Overcast and Castro as
well.

##### Google Play Music

Sign up at [Google Play Music
Podcasts](%20https://play.google.com/music/podcasts/) with your show’s
RSS feed and validate with your author email address.

##### Google Podcasts

As long as your website is easily searchable, Google should add it
automatically. Use [Google Webmaster
Tools](https://www.google.com/webmasters/#?modal_active=none "Google Webmaster Tools")
to verify this and be patient as it can take several days.

##### Spotify

Go to [Spotify for Podcasters](https://podcasters.spotify.com) and
submit your RSS feed and validate. Some podcast host services offer this
automatically such as
<a href="https://transistor.fm/?via=leo" target="_blank"
rel="noreferrer noopener"
aria-label="Transistor.FM (opens in a new tab)">Transistor.FM</a>[.](https://podcasters.spotify.com)

##### Stitcher

Submit your RSS feed through [the partner
portal](https://partners.stitcher.com/PartnerAddFeed.php) and validate
your email address.

##### Breaker

Submit your RSS feed through [Breaker
Upstream](https://www.breaker.audio/i/upstream) and verify your email
address.

##### Pocket Casts

Submit your [RSS feed to Pocket Casts](https://pocketcasts.com/submit)
and validate your email address.

##### Pandora

<a href="https://www.ampplaybook.com/podcasts/" target="_blank"
rel="noreferrer noopener"
aria-label="Submit your RSS feed at the Pandora AMP Playbook. (opens in a new tab)">Submit
your RSS feed at the Pandora AMP Playbook.</a>

##### CastBox.fm

Apply through [creator
studio](https://castbox.fm/login?jump_uri=%252Fcreator%252Fchannels&country=us)
and confirm with email address.

##### Radio Public

Submit your RSS feed for [Radio Public
here](https://podcasters.radiopublic.com/signup) and validate your email
address.

##### Tune In

Submit your RSS feed and other info to [Tune In
here](https://help.tunein.com/contact/add-podcast-S19TR3Sdf).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Most importantly, for many of these services, it could take days for
submission to work. Surprisingly, some clients like iTunes Connect,
actually mirror, or download and re-host your podcast on their platform.
Additionally, if you are interested in reaching Alexa, check out [this
talk I hosted recently where Paul Schmidt talks about turning podcast
episodes into Alexa
skills](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrgWN6zEQtA&t=1s). As a result,
now that we have our podcast available on a variety of platforms the
next step is reaching your audience.

### Reaching Your Podcast Audience

Congrats on getting your show recorded, edited, and hosted. However the
real challenge in podcasting comes from growing your audience. In that
case, part of that is SEO tricks which can take advantage of Google and
various podcast clients. Rather, you can go back to how you found your
audience earlier and answer those questions with summaries and
subscribable links to your episodes. By this means, you can realiably
reach your audience directly.

#### Sharing on Social Media

Social media has its advantages and disadvantages. However, if you don’t
have an existing audience, it can lead to not much return on your time.
Nevertheless if you do post to social media, make sure it’s a platform
your audience uses. For instance, converting 30 second clips into videos
are a great way to capture your audiences attention. Such as, [this
script I have written to convert 30 second mp3 files into videos for
social
media](https://gist.github.com/leogdion/2e5f9b8311d6ecdc8c8202eadba0861d).
Additionally, Erik, my OK Productive co-host and I use tools like
<a href="https://buffer.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"
aria-label="Buffer (opens in a new tab)">Buffer</a> to automate the
process. Surprisingly, the other way to reach your audience is by an
email newsletter.

#### Emailing Your Audience

Email may seem antiquated but [newsletters are more guaranteed to reach
your audience then any social media
channel.](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/19/technology/new-social-network-email-newsletter.html)
Accordingly, with email addresses, you can also directly reach your
audience and get their feedback. As a result, once you have enough of a
large audience, you begin to focus other written content as well and
gauge interest accordingly.

## The Whys and Hows of Podcasting

Now you have a roadmap for discerning and getting started podcasting -
from idea to publishing. Firstly, before jumping in, make sure the
audience is there as well as your passion and expertise on the topic.
Most importantly, have basic recording equipment and test recording an
episode before posting. At the same time, begin having talking points
and a schedule for recording. Consequently, find a good hosting provider
for your mp3 and make sure to export in the correct format. As soon as,
you have at least 3 episodes posted to your host, publish your RSS feed
to various services. As a result, share your episodes on social media,
in various audience websites and forums, and perhaps start an email
newsletter to keep your subscribers in touch. to sum up, while
podcasting is work, it can be lots of fun. Most importantly, you can
always put in as much work as wish. If you have any questions, please be
sure to reach out to me. I’d love to hear your podcasting stories and
lessons you’ve learned.
